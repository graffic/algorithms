# Maximum difference between 2 subarrays

Given an array of integers. Find the two subarrays that maximize the absolute difference of their individual max. Give back the difference.

For example, the array [1, 3, -3]:
 * [1]/[3,-3] -> This gives an abs(1-3) of 2
 * [1,3]/ [-3] -> This gives an abs(3 -(-3)) of 6 < we choose this number
