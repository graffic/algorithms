Training/practice coding exercises from different sites and books.

I tend to forget specific algo tricks after 2 months. I hope this repo helps to refresh my memory. Perhaps it also might help you if you're looking for examples.

## Elixir

All files are scripts `.exs`. Run the tests with `elixir path/to/file`

## Python

Use Python 3.6. And run doctests with `python -m doctest path/to/file`

You can also create a virtual environment and use `pytest` to run all the tests from the root directory.

## Javascript

Use node 8.x. You can run doctests with `yarn doctest path/to/file`
